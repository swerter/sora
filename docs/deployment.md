# Deployment Guide

This guide covers common scenarios for deploying Sora.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying Sora, you will need:

1.  **A PostgreSQL Server**: Version 9.6 or newer. The `pg_trgm` and `btree_gin` extensions must be enabled on the database (`CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm; CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS btree_gin;`). Both ship with contrib and are trusted, so the database owner can install them without superuser rights.
2.  **S3-Compatible Object Storage**: An S3 bucket from a provider like AWS, or a self-hosted solution like MinIO.
3.  **A Mail Transfer Agent (MTA)**: Such as Postfix or Exim, to handle SMTP and deliver mail to Sora via LMTP.

## Database Migrations

Sora uses a schema for its PostgreSQL database. Before running the server for the first time, and after any upgrade, you must run the database migrations using the `sora-admin` tool.

```bash
./sora-admin -config /path/to/config.toml migrate up
```

## Scenario 1: Single-Node Deployment

This is the simplest way to run Sora, with all components on a single instance. It's suitable for smaller-scale deployments or for testing.

### Architecture

```
+--------------+      LMTP      +-----------------+
|      MTA     | -------------> |                 |
+--------------+                |   Sora Server   |      +-------------+
                                | (IMAP,POP3,LMTP)| <--> |  PostgreSQL |
+--------------+      IMAP      |                 |      +-------------+
| Email Client | <------------> |                 |
+--------------+                +-----------------+      +-------------+
                                        ^          <--> | S3 Storage  |
                                        |                +-------------+
                                        +----------------+
```

### Configuration

1.  Create a `config.toml` file. Use the minimal configuration as a starting point.
2.  Fill in your database and S3 credentials.
3.  Ensure the paths for `local_cache` and `uploader` exist and are writable by the user running Sora.

### Mail Flow

You need to configure your MTA to deliver mail to Sora's LMTP socket. For Postfix, you would add the following to `main.cf`:

```
# Deliver mail to Sora via LMTP on port 24
virtual_transport = lmtp:127.0.0.1:24
```

## Scenario 2: Scaled, High-Availability (HA) Deployment

For larger deployments, you can run multiple Sora instances in a cluster for scalability and high availability. This involves running Sora in two modes: **proxy** and **backend**.

### Architecture

```
+--------------+      LMTP      +-----------------+
|      MTA     | -------------> |                 |
+--------------+                |   Sora Proxy    |
                                | (LMTP, IMAP, etc) |
+--------------+      IMAP      |                 |
| Email Client | <------------> |                 |
+--------------+                +-------+---------+
                                        |
                  +---------------------+---------------------+
                  | (Load Balancing & User-Server Affinity) |
                  v                     v                     v
        +-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
        |  Sora Backend 1 |   |  Sora Backend 2 |   |  Sora Backend N |
        +-----------------+   +-----------------+   +-----------------+
                 |                     |                     |
                 |                     |                     |
                 +----------+----------+----------+----------+
                            |                     |
                            v                     v
                  +-----------------+   +-----------------+
                  |  PostgreSQL     |   |   S3 Storage    |
                  |  (Write/Read_Replicas)   |   |                 |
                  +-----------------+   +-----------------+
```

### Configuration

You will have two different `config.toml` files: one for your proxy nodes and one for your backend nodes.

**Proxy `config.toml`:**
*   Enable the `*_proxy` servers (e.g., `servers.imap_proxy`, `servers.lmtp_proxy`).
*   Disable the regular protocol servers (e.g., `servers.imap.start = false`).
*   In each proxy section, define the `remote_addrs` list with the addresses of your backend nodes.
*   Enable `enable_affinity = true` to provide a better user experience.
*   Configure `master_sasl_username` and `master_sasl_password` which the proxy will use to authenticate to the backends.

**Backend `config.toml`:**
*   This configuration is similar to the single-node setup.
*   Enable the regular protocol servers (`servers.imap`, `servers.lmtp`, etc.).
*   Disable the proxy servers.
*   Configure the `master_sasl_username` and `master_sasl_password` in the `[servers.imap]` (and other protocols) section to match what the proxy is configured to use.
*   For improved performance, configure `[database.read]` to point to PostgreSQL read-replicas.


## Connection Poolers (PgBouncer)

Sora works behind PgBouncer in any pooling mode, including transaction pooling. Nothing session-scoped is relied on: statement and lock timeouts are applied with `SET LOCAL`, and every advisory lock is transaction-scoped (`pg_advisory_xact_lock`), held in a dedicated transaction that stays open exactly as long as the lock is needed.

Some of those locks span an S3 round trip, so they keep one pooled connection (one server connection behind the pooler) checked out while that round trip runs:

- the uploader's per-object lock: one per in-flight upload, up to `[uploader] concurrency` per node;
- the cleaner: two on the node running a cycle, the cycle lock for the whole cycle plus the per-batch lock during each S3 delete;
- IMAP COPY between accounts: one per copy in flight, held across the S3 existence check and copy.

Size the pooler's pool for the write user with that in mind:

```
pool_size >= nodes × uploader.concurrency + 2 + headroom for interactive writes and cross-account copies
```

A pool sized only for short IMAP/LMTP transactions queues mail delivery behind slow S3 transfers, most visibly during an S3 outage when uploads sit in retry. Lower `concurrency` or raise the pool.

Sora keeps a held lock transaction alive with a statement at least every minute, so PostgreSQL's `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` must be well above that. A shorter setting kills the lock holder mid-transfer; the transfer is then abandoned and retried, not lost.

Session-level advisory locks (`pg_advisory_lock`) must never be introduced: through a transaction pooler the lock and its unlock land on different backends, the lock strands until the pooler retires that backend, and enough stranded locks fill PostgreSQL's shared lock table, at which point every session fails with `out of shared memory` (SQLSTATE 53200). A source-scan test (`db.TestNoSessionLevelAdvisoryLocksInProductionCode`) enforces this.
