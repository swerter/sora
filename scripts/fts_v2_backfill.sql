-- Backfill messages_fts_v2 from messages_fts. Runbook: docs/fts-v2-rollout.md.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A DATA MIGRATION AND NOT A CACHE REBUILD
--   text_body is nulled the moment its vector is computed (db/fts.go), so the tsvector in
--   messages_fts is the ONLY copy of that data. It cannot be recomputed without re-fetching
--   and re-parsing every message body from S3. Losing it loses body search for existing mail.
--   Run this before the new binary is deployed, and do not drop messages_fts until the soak.
--
-- HOW TO RUN
--   psql -h <primary> -p 5432 -d <db> -f scripts/fts_v2_backfill.sql
--   Connect DIRECTLY to the primary, never through a transaction pooler: the procedures below
--   COMMIT between batches, which a transaction pooler will not carry correctly.
--
--   Recency-first, so the mail users actually search becomes searchable first and an aborted
--   run still leaves the useful part done. Run EACH CALL AS ITS OWN STATEMENT -- one
--   `psql -c` per CALL, or one per line in an interactive session. Several CALLs in a single
--   `psql -c "...; ..."` run as one implicit transaction, and the procedures' COMMITs then
--   fail with "invalid transaction termination":
--     CALL fts_v2_backfill_recent(interval '24 months', 5000, 200);  -- newest first
--     CALL fts_v2_backfill_rest(5000, 200);                          -- everything older
--     CALL fts_v2_catchup(0);                                        -- pairs missed in flight
--   Later catch-up passes resume from the id the previous pass prints, not from 0.
--   Check progress with: SELECT * FROM fts_v2_verification();
--
--   Completion is recorded in fts_v2_backfill_state, and migration 000050 refuses to run on a
--   large installation unless `rest` completed. If you deliberately backfill only recent mail
--   (accepting that older mail is not body-searchable), record that decision explicitly:
--     INSERT INTO fts_v2_backfill_state (step) VALUES ('accept_partial');
--
--   Every procedure is resumable: re-running continues from where it stopped, and running one
--   twice is a no-op. Progress is RAISE NOTICE'd per batch.
--
-- PACING
--   batch_rows = hashes per transaction, sleep_ms = pause between transactions. Start at
--   (5000, 200) and watch pg_stat_replication.replay_lag on all three replicas. Searches are
--   served EXCLUSIVELY by replicas, so replica lag is directly user-visible: raise sleep_ms
--   the moment lag grows.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Progress record. Migration 000050 reads it: on a large installation it refuses to run
-- unless 'rest' (everything) completed, or an operator recorded 'accept_partial'. 'recent'
-- also stores the lower bound it covered, so 'rest' can start below it instead of re-reading
-- every vector 'recent' already copied.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS fts_v2_backfill_state (
    step         text        PRIMARY KEY CHECK (step IN ('recent', 'rest', 'accept_partial')),
    lo           timestamptz,
    completed_at timestamptz NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Core batch. Returns rows inserted and the cursor for the next page.
--
-- Pagination is KEYSET on (sent_date, content_hash) descending, not a plain watermark.
-- A watermark of `sent_date <= last_seen` re-selects the boundary row forever and never
-- terminates; a strict `<` on sent_date alone silently skips every row that ties on that
-- timestamp. The composite cursor is unique (content_hash is the PK), so it always advances
-- and never skips. It must also advance past hashes that insert NOTHING -- an orphan hash
-- with no messages row is a legitimate candidate that yields zero pairs, and "loop until a
-- batch inserts nothing" would spin on it forever.
--
-- Drives from messages_fts (small) and enumerates accounts with an INDEX-ONLY scan on the
-- existing idx_messages_content_hash_account_id (content_hash, account_id). The DISTINCT is
-- on account_id alone inside the LATERAL: never DISTINCT over the row, because
-- text_body_tsv is TOASTed and sorting it would dominate the whole job.
--
-- Keep it index-only: do NOT join mailboxes here. A row belongs to the mailbox OWNER (the
-- account every search scopes to), and messages.account_id is the owner for all mail
-- delivered since June 2026. Only older mail that someone else added to a shared mailbox
-- differs (0 rows on production). Joining mailboxes to catch those would turn this into a
-- heap fetch plus a mailbox lookup for every message row in the table. The catch-up below
-- keys on the owner, and its first pass (from id 0) adds any such owner-keyed rows.
--
-- No expunged_at filter, deliberately. The orphan sweep counts ANY messages row including
-- expunged ones (db/cleaner.go), and `sora-admin messages restore` un-expunges rows without
-- recreating FTS data. Filtering here would make restored mail permanently unsearchable.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- The previous version had no p_hi. CREATE OR REPLACE with a different argument list adds an
-- overload instead of replacing it, so drop it first.
