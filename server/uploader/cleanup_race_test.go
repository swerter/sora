package uploader

// This file contains a test that reproduces the race condition where
// cleanupOrphanedFiles() deletes a local upload file whose corresponding
// pending_upload DB record hasn't committed yet.
//
// Scenario:
//  1. A message is delivered: StoreLocally() writes the file to disk.
//  2. The DB transaction (InsertMessage + pending_uploads INSERT) is still in-flight.
//  3. cleanupOrphanedFiles() fires (e.g., on the 5-minute tick).
//  4. The file is old enough to pass the grace-period check (or clock skew bypassed it).
//  5. PendingUploadExistsWithRetry() returns false — the record isn't visible yet.
//  6. The file is deleted by cleanupOrphanedFiles().
//  7. The DB transaction commits: pending_upload record now exists, but the file is gone.
//  8. Every subsequent upload attempt fails with "no such file or directory".
//     The upload reaches maxAttempts and stays stuck forever. S3 shows MISSING.
//
// The test below is intentionally written to FAIL against the current code,
// proving that the safety invariant is violated.
